# Pump Classification Using Naive Bayes Classifier
This project is a direct application of the Naive Bayes Classifier to a real world scenerio. 
In this project, the classifier is used to predict the functionality of various water
pumps across Tanzania. This model will take into account several
factors from the given dataset and output the predicted functionality
class for the given pumps. With these predictions I will build a
Graphical User Interface (GUI) in RStudio to show the locations
via longitude and latitude of the water pumps and their associated
status for users to see.

A more detailed and thorough explanation can be found in the report located in the repository.
